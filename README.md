## A new system of Economy

Have you wanted to write plugins that
- Allow you to track money created and destroyed
- Have some actual semblance of real banking practices
- Enable players to unite and ruin the world with the power of unfettered capitalism

# Welcome to Prototype2 (name wip)

This plugin will provide to server owners, developers and players the ability to
create the kind of economic structures we see day-to-day in the real world.

Examples:
- Banks - People have ideas and time but lack resources. We can lend!
- Credit Unions - same idea, but ownership by member players.
- Brokers - Someone wants to dump their commodity they actually just duped at the
 adminshop and kill the economy? Too bad. MM says no = no crazy inflation of M1.
- Central banks - Because currencies can be used and misused. Put the power of
 central banking into the hands of trusted players and let's see what happens.
- International markets - Debt, commodities, currencies you name it.
- State debt - Public works are amazing. We can all pitch in and be better off.
- Seigniorage - Virtual currency costs nothing, but what if it didn't?
- Taxes - Backup monetary policy

My real dream is for this plugin to allow for the simulation of paradigms so far
untested or (under-tested) at a larger scale in the real world.

Examples include:
- UBI, Universal Basic Income - aka what if ?we gave everyone $1,000 everyday?
 would they actually just sit on their butts, or would they be able to finally
 purchase items they've needed and invest in their local communities the way
 they have wanted to?
- SWFs, Sovereign Wealth Funds - States invest public revenue back into the
 private sector, hedging against their tendency to be their own undoing
- World bank/World currency - The U.S. Dollar maintains a level of hegemony in
 the real world among the IMF's basket of reserve currencies, but we have yet
 to move away from the inflexible SDR and toward a proper, liquid, and equitable
 system that appreciates trade surpluses and deficits.
